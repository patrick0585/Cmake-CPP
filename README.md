I use this project structure for CPP projects with CMake.

Project structure<br />
=================<br />
|-- src                 Application source code and headers<br />
|-- test                Unit tests<br />
|-- thirdparty          Third party libraries included with this project<br />
|-- tools               Scripts/Programs used during development or during the build process<br />
`-- CMakeLists.txt      Main project build file.<br />
